A simple script, that gives you ability to color your dialogs in vkontakte social network (https://vk.com).
You need Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey or any other browser extension, that allows user scripts installation. 
To see script actually working, just go to any of your vk dialogs. You'll find a new tab on your right, just under 
the list of your currently opened dialogs. The tab contains the name of a friend you're currently chatting with and a 
color picker button. Press the button to choose color for your dialog (choose white color to set default one). Go to your 
dialogs list after that, you'll see the result immediately.
